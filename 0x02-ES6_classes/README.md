This project focuses on understanding and implementing ES6 classes in JavaScript. ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced a new way to work with object-oriented programming in JavaScript, making it more efficient and developer-friendly.

The goal of this project is to explain how to define and use ES6 classes, and the key concepts related to object-oriented programming in JavaScript. A set of class-based exercises would be implemented to solidify the understanding of ES6 classes.
