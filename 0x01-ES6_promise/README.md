This project ES6 Promises, is part of the curriculum at ALX and it focuses on the concept and usage of Promises in JavaScript, specifically as implemented in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). Promises are a fundamental aspect of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, providing a way to work with asynchronous operations more effectively and handle their outcomes in a structured manner.

In this project, the goal is to create and work with Promises, understand their syntax and methods, and leverage them to manage asynchronous code execution and handle success or failure outcomes gracefully.
